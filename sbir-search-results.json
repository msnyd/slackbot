        "Description": "The SBIR Technology Transfer (SBIR-TT) Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is intended to help move commercially-viable technologies from the NIH Intramural Program to the marketplace. Small Business Concerns (SBCs) are encouraged to submit applications that further develop available technologies from the NIH Intramural Program and bring them to the commercial market. While universities can spin off companies, use incubator resources, and obtain funding from venture capital, the NIH intramural programs have no similar mechanism to develop technologies. If selected for SBIR funding, the SBC will be granted a royalty-free, non-exclusive patent license agreement for internal research use for the term of and within the field of use of the SBIR award to technologies held by NIH with the intent that the SBC will develop the invention into a commercial product to benefit the public. For a complete listing of NIH intramural technologies which are available, please see NIH Office of Technology Transfer at: https:\/\/www.ott.nih.gov or the web sites of the technology transfer offices of the participating Institutes.\n\n\t\tThe NIH Intramural Research Program leverages the unique NIH research environment to perform interdisciplinary research from the bench to bedside. Investigators conduct basic, translational, and clinical research at NIH campuses across the country. As part of the SBIR-TT project, an NIH intramural investigator may provide assistance in a collaborative manner by providing technology, reagents and\/or discussions during the SBIR award period. No SBIR funds are allowed to go to the NIH intramural investigator or to the NIH intramural program.\n\n\t\tSmall business concerns should submit an SBIR application through Grants.gov using the SF424(R&amp;R) application package. SBCs are encouraged to submit a license application to the technology transfer office of the participating institute before submitting an SBIR application. The SBIR application will be reviewed by the NIH Center for Scientific Review (CSR), while license applications will be reviewed by the institute&amp;#39;s technology transfer office.  Under the NIH SBIR-TT program, the SBIR grant review process will be conducted in parallel with, but distinct from, the review of any application for a license.

        "Description": "Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is the most widely used growth supplement for cell culture; it cost-effectively supports the survival, growth, and differentiation of many cell lines by providing nutrients, growth signals, and protection from stress. Although serum is an effective growth promoter, it is variable in its composition, activity, and effects on cellular phenotypes. This variability introduces inconsistencies into research using cultured cells. Sometimes it is possible to replicate experimental results only if the same manufacturer&amp;#39;s serum is used; sometimes replication is only possible using serum from the same lot. Vendor literature and scientific reviews advise investigators to test lots of serum to identify those that support the desired cellular responses, and then buy a quantity of the best lot for long term use. This practice is widespread but can make replication of results by others difficult.\n\n\t\tSerum contains hundreds, perhaps thousands, of constituents. These include macromolecules, small molecules, and trace elements; for any cell line a large and variable subset of these may be active in supporting cell growth. The composition and concentrations of factors in serum vary with the source animals&amp;#39; diets, geographical locations, gestational stages, gender, health, season of harvesting, and histories of exposures to hormones, antibiotics, and environmental chemicals. Harvesting practices, manufacturing processes and additives, and differences in quality control and handling introduce additional variation. Serum is a byproduct of the meat-processing industry; dependence on serum is a barrier to translation of cell-based therapies because of the risk of transmission of viruses, prions, endotoxins, and immunogens.\n\n\t\tSerum supplies factors that support cell growth through mechanisms that are not well understood, but includes hormones, enzymes, extracellular vesicles and proteins, extracellular matrix constituents, attachment and spreading factors, vitamins and minerals, trace elements, lipids, protease inhibitors, and other stabilizing and detoxifying factors. Substitute formulations for serum are expensive and time-consuming to develop and are cell-type specific; some cell lines cannot be grown with presently-available serum replacements. Although serum substitutes can support the growth of many cell types in culture, they often do not support robust survival and the same range of responses as does serum. Thus, serum continues to be widely used in many research settings where it is not economically practical to customize substitutes for it.\n\n\t\tThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) addresses the needs of developers and users for supporting technologies and products to expedite (a) development of better serum substitutes, (b) identification of serum constituents that are effective in promoting the culture and responses of specific cell lines, and (c) troubleshooting of experimental variation stemming from variability in serum.

        "TopicTitle": "Novel Tools and Devices for Animal Research Facilities and to Support Care of Animal Models (R41\/R42 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) ",
        "Description": "Many NIH-funded research projects rely on vertebrate and invertebrate animals to study basics of biology and physiology, to investigate pathological conditions, to build models of human diseases, and to design novel therapies and translational procedures. ORIP plays a vital role in the area of NIH-funded animal model research by supporting specialized animal research facilities and the development of animal models of human diseases.\n\nORIP encourages applications from small business concerns (SBCs) for Small Business technology Transfer (STTR) projects to develop novel engineering solutions and implement them as devices, tools, or software to improve handling of laboratory animals, to ease the management of animal facilities, and to enhance experiments which use animal models.\n\nDifferent animal model species require different environmental conditions to ensure optimal health and well-being. Environmental conditions such as diet, water, air quality, and temperature alter organ function, modify cellular activity, and influence molecular reactions, and hence, affect animal\n\nphysiology and behavior. Monitoring environmental conditions is an essential everyday task of a laboratory animal facility manager, to ensure the health of animals.\n\nNovel devices and tools for such monitoring are needed to improve both the quality of animal care and the subsequent research generated from the use of animal models, including reproducibility of experimental results.\n\nIn order to consistently maintain the desired quality of air, water, and cage environment, there is a need for equipment in animal facilities to promote more efficient operational procedures. Application of novel and green technologies for controlling and managing environmental conditions in the animal facilities is particularly desired\n\nIn parallel, a class of devices to identify types and levels of various pathogens and other contaminants in air, water, and cage liners would help with monitoring specific laboratory conditions. The level and type of infectious agents and other contaminants are factors contributing to differences in physiological responses between individual animals and between entire colonies. These and other factors are especially hard to account for in and across distant geographical locations. Improved devices and tools to monitor animal facilities would eliminate or minimize exposure of personnel and animals to pathogens or allergens; resulting in better experimental outcomes without confounding variables.\n\nThere is a related need for cost-saving devices to non-invasively or minimally-invasively monitor physiological parameters and bodily functions. This class of devices includes specialized accessories for laboratory equipment to improve the conduct and outcomes of standard procedures. Such devices should be robust, easy to use, and portable, depending on the animal model species and the functions being monitored. Connecting diet, environmental conditions, and physiological measurements gives a global picture of health and the life-history of individual animals and colonies. Properly accounting for such factors would help in controlling experimental conditions and with understanding some differences in experimental outcomes.\n\nIn addition, there is the need for novel devices and instruments to help with handling and restraining of animals. Such devices should reduce the stress to animals and also to the researcher; stress represents an experimental variable and should be controlled and minimized whenever possible.\n\nOverall, improvements in tools and procedures which contribute to the health and well-being of laboratory animals are very important in achieving optimal experimental outcomes. There is the persistent need for better understanding of controllable factors which contribute to stress of animals. Technologically advanced devices for behavioral monitoring of animals are needed; also needed are devices that enrich the lives of laboratory animal models and promote physical activity. Similarly, there is the need for better tools for monitoring and controlling, when appropriate, the food and water intake of individual animals.\n\nIn parallel, there is the need for improved methods and devices for tagging, tracking, and monitoring individual animals. Not only will such tools aid in managing individual animals, but they should also help in overseeing entire animal colonies, managing animal husbandry, and lead to improvements in research protocols and understanding of research outcomes. To implement such goals for the management of animal colonies, there is a place for new software for combining data from different types of monitoring devices, compatible with different data formats and linkable to existing databases for different animal species.\n\nWith this FOA, ORIP encourages the SBCs to develop and implement novel tools and devices to improve animal welfare, to ease the management of individual animals and animal colonies, to improve the detection capabilities of environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, vibrations, ultrasonic noise), to help control factors in animal facilities which affect experimental conditions, and to modernize the physical infrastructure of animal facilities.\n\nInnovation is an important component of productive engineering efforts; however, new ideas are not a sufficient factor for designing and building a useful tool. The concept of innovation in the context of engineering endeavors and non-hypothesis driven research should be understood broadly. For example, a technology which is well established in one field and adapted to different field and may open new research areas, enable novel scientific discoveries, change and improve experimental procedures, and have impact wider than its original scope. Hence, novel tools and devices should be measured by the users\u2019 needs they fulfill, and by the overall benefits and improvements they bring to a field of science.\n\nHardware and software implementations of better technological solutions should bring improvements in efficiency and accuracy of animal-handling practices and experimental procedures. These new devices and tools should be durable, reliable, and easy to use and maintain.

        "TopicTitle": "Novel Tools and Devices for Animal Research Facilities and to Support Care of Animal Models (R43\/R44 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) ",
        "Description": "Many NIH-funded research projects rely on vertebrate and invertebrate animals to study basics of biology and physiology, to investigate pathological conditions, to build models of human disease pathways, and to design novel therapies and translational procedures. ORIP plays a vital role in the area of NIH-funded animal model research by supporting specialized animal research facilities and the development of animal models of human diseases.\n\nORIP encourages applications from small business concerns (SBCs) for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) projects to develop novel engineering solutions and implement them as devices, tools, or software to improve handling of laboratory animals, to ease the management of animal facilities, and to enhance experiments which use animal models.\n\nDifferent animal model species require different environmental conditions to ensure optimal health and well-being. Environmental conditions such as diet, water, air quality, and temperature alter organ function, modify cellular activity, and influence molecular reactions, and hence, affect animal physiology and behavior. Monitoring environmental conditions is an essential everyday task of a laboratory animal facility manager, to ensure the health of animals.\n\nNovel devices and tools for such monitoring are needed to improve both the quality of animal care and the subsequent research generated from the use of animal models, including reproducibility of experimental results.\n\nIn order to consistently maintain the desired quality of air, water, and cage environment, there is a need for equipment in animal facilities to promote more efficient operational procedures. Application of novel and green technologies for controlling and managing environmental conditions in the animal facilities is particularly desired.\n\n In parallel, a class of devices to identify types and levels of various pathogens and other contaminants in air, water, and cage liners would help with monitoring specific laboratory conditions. The level and type of infectious agents and other contaminants are factors contributing to differences in physiological responses between individual animals and between entire colonies. These and other factors are especially hard to account for in and across distant geographical locations. Improved devices and tools to monitor animal facilities would eliminate or minimize exposure of personnel and animals to pathogens or allergens; resulting in better experimental outcomes without confounding variables.\n\nThere is a related need for cost-saving devices to non-invasively or minimally-invasively monitor physiological parameters and bodily functions. This class of devices includes specialized accessories for laboratory equipment to improve the conduct and outcomes of standard procedures. Such devices should be robust, easy to use, and portable, depending on the animal model species and the functions being monitored. Connecting diet, environmental conditions, and physiological measurements gives a global picture of health and the life-history of individual animals and colonies. Properly accounting for such factors would help in controlling experimental conditions and with understanding some differences in experimental outcomes.\n\nIn addition, there is the need for novel devices and instruments to help with handling and restraining of animals. Such devices should reduce the stress to animals and also to the researcher; stress represents an experimental variable and should be controlled and minimized whenever possible.\n\nOverall, improvements in tools and procedures which contribute to the health and well-being of laboratory animals are very important in achieving optimal experimental outcomes. There is the persistent need for better understanding of controllable factors which contribute to stress of animals. Technologically advanced devices for behavioral monitoring of animals are needed; also needed are devices that enrich the lives of laboratory animal models and promote physical activity. Similarly, there is the need for better tools for monitoring and controlling, when appropriate, the food and water intake of individual animals.\n\nIn parallel, there is the need for improved methods and devices for tagging, tracking, and monitoring individual animals. Not only will such tools aid in managing individual animals, but they should also help in overseeing entire animal colonies, managing animal husbandry, and lead to improvements in research protocols and understanding of research outcomes. To implement such goals for the management of animal colonies, there is a place for new software for combining data from different types of monitoring devices, compatible with different data formats and linkable to existing databases for different animal species.\n\nWith this FOA, ORIP encourages the SBCs to develop and implement novel tools and devices to improve animal welfare, to ease the management of individual animals and animal colonies, to improve the detection capabilities of environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, vibrations, ultrasonic noise), to help control factors in animal facilities which affect experimental conditions, and to modernize the physical infrastructure of animal facilities.\n\nInnovation is an important component of productive engineering efforts; however, new ideas are not a sufficient factor for designing and building a useful tool. The concept of innovation in the context of engineering endeavors and non-hypothesis driven research should be understood broadly. For example, a technology which is well established in one field and adapted to a different field may open new research areas, enable novel scientific discoveries, change and improve experimental procedures, and have impact wider than its original scope. Hence, novel tools and devices should be measured by the users\u2019 needs they fulfill, and by the overall benefits and improvements they bring to a field of science.\n\nHardware and software implementations of better technological solutions should bring improvements in efficiency and accuracy of animal-handling practices and experimental procedures. These new devices and tools should be durable, reliable, and easy to use and maintain. Importantly, they should offer cost-savings in purchase and operational costs.\n\nThese efforts are important for a broad class of animal research models, including but not limited to widely used model species such as fruit fly, worm, mouse, rat, zebrafish, frog, rabbit, swine, dog, and nonhuman primates. We emphasize that this FOA applies to invertebrate and vertebrate animals.\n\nDisease-specific devices are not covered under this FOA (e.g., glucose monitors, brain probes for specific neurological conditions, or cancer imaging tools). Nor are reagents and experimental protocols appropriate for this FOA.\n\nThe development and implementation of novel equipment and enhancement of existing tools include, but are not limited to the following specific examples:\n\n\n\t Portable and robust software to help manage (including husbandry protocol procedures and assessment) and evaluate animal colonies;\n\tCost saving and reliable non-invasive or minimally invasive technology for tracking systems for monitoring animals, that either connect to or can easily communicate with existing formats and computer databases;\n\tNovel automated feeding systems, compatible with tagging and tracking devices to allow quantitation of feed consumption at the individual animal level;\n\tDevice and equipment to automate and support drug delivery by oral, subcutaneous, arterial, venous, or intracerebroventricular\/intracerebral routes, and related methods to measure drug uptake and their technological implementation in species-specific devices;\n\tRobust and accurate devices for non-invasive measurement of physiological parameters such as heart rate and blood pressure in rodents and other species used in research;\n\tImproved systems for collection of multi-source data (including telemetric and extrinsic variables) and their analysis for comprehensive behavioral assessment;\n\tBetter and cost-saving devices for phenotyping at the organismal as well as at the molecular levels;\n\tSocial and non-social enrichment devices, including novel foraging devices and devices oriented towards challenging manipulation tasks for nonhuman primates;\n\tSafe and improved holding, restraining, and transfer devices for routine care, and for intra-facility transport such as large animal transfer chutes and nonhuman primate chair restraint;\n\tBetter and cost-saving air and water filters for metabolic cages, aquaria, and other facility equipment;\n\tBetter bedding materials (e.g., self-displaying levels of contaminants and microorganisms, odor-absorbent, recyclable);\n\tBetter and easy to use tools and devices to measure levels of pathogens and contaminants in cages, aquaria, and facilities;\n\tBetter disinfectant and devices\/tools\/equipment to sanitize and disinfect animal facility and related equipment.\n\n\nApplicants are advised to discuss their projects with the Scientific\/Research contacts before submitting an application.\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII.

        "Description": "Background\n\nThe Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, also known as America&apos;s Seed Fund, are one of the largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization in the United States. These programs enable US-owned and operated small businesses to conduct research and development that has a strong potential for commercialization. National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) support small businesses through the SBIR and STTR programs to translate promising technologies and products to the private sector that align with their mission to improve health and save lives. \n\nThe SBIR program, as established by law and reauthorized under Public Law 114-328, Section 1834 and Public Law 115-232, is intended to meet the following goals: stimulate technological innovation in the private sector; strengthen the role of small business in meeting federal research and development needs; increase the private sector commercialization of innovations developed through federal research and development funding; foster and encourage participation in innovation and entrepreneurship by women and socially or economically disadvantaged persons. In addition, the STTR program aims to foster technology transfer through cooperative research and development between small businesses and research institutions. Federal agencies with extramural research budgets over $100 million are required to set-aside 3.2% of their budget to SBIR, and those with research budgets over $1 billion are required to set aside 0.45% of funds for STTR. \n\nThe SBIR\/STTR program is a phased program. The main objective in SBIR\/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts, whereas in SBIR\/STTR Phase II it is to continue the R&amp;D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. \n\nAn objective of the SBIR and STTR programs is to increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federally supported research and development. At the conclusion of an SBIR\/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR\/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal). \n\nPurpose\n\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I, Phase II, Fast-Track, and Phase IIB grant applications. Small business applicants interested in submitting an SBIR grant application should submit to PA-20-260 or PA-20-262. Direct to Phase II applications can only be accepted through the SBIR program.\n\nNIH Fast-Track: An NIH STTR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases.  \n\nNIH Phase IIB: Some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable financing beyond the SBIR and STTR Phase II to achieve commercialization. NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) may allow small businesses who have been awarded a Phase II SBIR or STTR to submit a Phase IIB (second, sequential Phase II) STTR application that will provide additional funding for Phase II SBIR or STTR projects. These renewals are typically offered for those projects that require extraordinary time and effort, including those requiring regulatory approval or developing complex instrumentation, clinical research tools, and behavioral interventions. Commercial potential (i.e. the probability that an application will result in a commercial product) will be strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information) and making funding decisions. Applicants are encouraged to secure substantial independent third-party investor funds (i.e., third-party funds that equal or exceed the requested NIH funds). An applicant&apos;s ability to secure substantial independent third-party investor funds will help validate the commercial potential of the proposed STTR Phase IIB project. Examples of third-party investors include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an angel investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, or a State or local government, or any combination of the above. Applicants should provide a commercialization plan that describes the long-term commercialization strategy and details on any independent third-party investor funding that has already been secured or will be provided during the Phase IIB project period. If applicable, the application should include letters of support from third-party investors.\n\nNIH ICs that accept Phase IIB applications, either through this STTR FOA or other specific FOAs, are listed in the PHS 2020-2 SBIR\/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA. Additional requirements and instructions (e.g., submission of a letter of intent) are available in the specific IC research topics section and in the NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities that allow Phase IIB applications. \n\nSpecific Objectives\n\nThe PHS 2020-2 SBIR\/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA represent scientific program areas that may be of interest to applicant small businesses in the development of projects that have potential for commercialization. Small business concerns that have the research capabilities and technological expertise to contribute to the R&amp;D mission(s) of the NIH, CDC, or FDA awarding components identified in this FOA are encouraged to submit STTR grant applications in these areas. STTR grant applications will also be accepted and considered in any area within the mission of the Components of Participating Organizations listed for this FOA. In addition to the general STTR solicitations, some awarding components have additional, specific NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities of potential interest to small businesses. \n\nApplicants are not required to identify a potential awarding component prior to submission of the application but may request one on the Assignment Request Form. Staff within the NIH\u2019s Center for Scientific Review (CSR) office, the single receiving point for all NIH, CDC, and FDA grant applications, will assign all applications to the most appropriate Agency and Institute\/Center (IC) based on their mission and the science proposed. For specific information about the mission of each NIH IC, visit the List of NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices website.\n\nAll applications submitted to this Parent Funding Opportunity Announcement are not allowed to propose clinical trial(s).

In addition to the general STTR solicitations, some awarding components have additional, specific NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities of potential interest to small businesses. \n\nApplicants are not required to identify a potential awarding component prior to submission of the application but may request one on the Assignment Request Form. Staff within the NIH\u2019s Center for Scientific Review (CSR) office, the single receiving point for all NIH, CDC, and FDA grant applications, will assign all applications to the most appropriate Agency and Institute\/Center (IC) based on their mission and the science proposed. For specific information about the mission of each NIH IC, visit the List of NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices website.\n\nAll applications submitted to this Parent Funding Opportunity Announcement must propose clinical trial(s). STTR applications that do not propose clinical trial(s) should be submitted to PA-20-265.\n\nApplicants should note that some ICs only accept applications proposing mechanistic studies through this funding opportunity announcement and are noted in the PHS 2020-2 SBIR\/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA. A mechanistic study is designed to understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. If the proposed research project includes clinical trial other than a mechanistic study that would be assigned to one of these ICs, applicants are advised to contact relevant Scientific\/Research staff to discuss alternative mechanisms of support of these studies.\n\nFurther information about the SBIR and STTR programs can be found at https:\/\/sbir.nih.gov\/. Frequently asked questions are available to assist applicants and can answer many basic questions about the program.",

        "Description": "Background\n\n\t\tG-protein coupled receptor proteins (GPCRs) are membrane bound proteins that serve to modulate cellular activities. Many of the GPCRs have potential significance in healthy mental function and in mental disorders, including receptors for most neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Drugs targeting GPCRs are currently used in the treatment of mental disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety and depression, yet the similarity of receptor subtypes has precluded the development of subtype selective agonists and antagonists as improved therapeutics with fewer side effects. Recent advances in GPCR biology have led to interest in biased agonism, allosteric modulators, GPCR dimers\/multimers, and 3-D structures as potential avenues to the development of compounds selective for particular receptor subtypes and downstream signaling pathways. Such compounds may hold promise both as research tools and lead compounds for drug development.\n\n\t\tResearch Objectives\n\n\t\tThe purpose of this funding opportunity is to encourage small businesses to develop technologies and approaches (i.e., novel ways to use new or existing technologies) that will enable researchers to better understand and manipulate the dynamic structure and\/or function of brain localized GPCRs and\/or potentially identify novel selective and specific agonists, antagonists, or allosteric modulators for these receptor subtypes, with a focus on mental health function or dysfunction. Technologies and approaches aimed at either well characterized receptor subtypes or understudied\/orphan receptors would be of potential interest to NIMH. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNovel technologies and approaches to further elucidate the structure and function of GPCRs might include: high resolution molecular imaging techniques, novel crystallization strategies, novel computational modeling strategies, novel technologies and\/or approaches to increase the yield of GPCR protein, etc.\n\t\t\tNovel technologies to determine the dimerization and\/or multimerization state of GPCRs in native neurons\n\t\t\tNovel tools to identify and characterize GPCR dimers and\/or multimers, such as dimer- or multimer-specific antibodies or new ways to generate such antibodies\n\t\t\tNovel assays of biased GPCR signaling that can be used to identify and characterize functionally selective agonists and allosteric modulators\n\t\t\tComputational approaches to structure-based design of GPCR agonists, antagonists, and allosteric modulators with superior receptor subtype or signaling specificity over existing compounds\n\t\t\tNovel technologies or approaches to identify and characterize understudied and\/or orphan GPCRs in the brain, such as adhesion GPCRs\n\t\t\tNovel technologies and approaches to profile GPCR activity across phyla, during development, and in different brain regions\/cell types \n\t\t\tDevelopment of methods to screen for novel GPCR interacting proteins. \n\t\t\n\n\t\tProtection of Human Subjects: Applications with data collection plans that involve multiple respondent groups (e.g., clients\/patients, therapists\/providers, supervisors, administrators) should address provisions for human subject protections and consenting procedures for all participant groups, accordingly. The NIMH has published updated policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection and clinical research data and safety monitoring (NOT-MH-15-025). The application&amp;#39;s Protection of Human Subjects section and data and safety monitoring plans should reflect the policies and guidance in this notice. Plans for the protection of research subjects and data and safety monitoring will be reviewed by the NIMH for consistency with NIMH and NIH policies and federal regulations.\n\n\t\tSee Section VIII.

        "TopicTitle": "Novel Tools for Investigating Brain-derived GPCRs in Mental Health Research (R43\/R44 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) ",
        "Description": "Background\n\n\t\tG-protein coupled receptor proteins (GPCRs) are membrane bound proteins that serve to modulate cellular activities. Many of the GPCRs have potential significance in healthy mental function and in mental disorders, including receptors for most neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Drugs targeting GPCRs are currently used in the treatment of mental disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety and depression, yet the similarity of receptor subtypes has precluded the development of subtype selective agonists and antagonists as improved therapeutics with fewer side effects. Recent advances in GPCR biology have led to interest in biased agonism, allosteric modulators, GPCR dimers\/multimers, and 3-D structures as potential avenues to the development of compounds selective for particular receptor subtypes and downstream signaling pathways. Such compounds may hold promise both as research tools and lead compounds for drug development.\n\n\t\tResearch Objectives\n\n\t\tThe purpose of this funding opportunity is to encourage small businesses to develop technologies and approaches (i.e., novel ways to use new or existing technologies) that will enable researchers to better understand and manipulate the dynamic structure and\/or function of brain localized GPCRs and\/or potentially identify novel selective and specific agonists, antagonists, or allosteric modulators for these receptor subtypes, with a focus on mental health function or dysfunction. Technologies and approaches aimed at either well characterized receptor subtypes or understudied\/orphan receptors would be of potential interest to NIMH. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNovel technologies and approaches to further elucidate the structure and function of GPCRs might include: high resolution molecular imaging techniques, novel crystallization strategies, novel computational modeling strategies, novel technologies and\/or approaches to increase the yield of GPCR protein, etc.\n\t\t\tNovel technologies to determine the dimerization and\/or multimerization state of GPCRs in native neurons\n\t\t\tNovel tools to identify and characterize GPCR dimers and\/or multimers, such as dimer- or multimer-specific antibodies or new ways to generate such antibodies\n\t\t\tNovel assays of biased GPCR signaling that can be used to identify and characterize functionally selective agonists and allosteric modulators\n\t\t\tComputational approaches to structure-based design of GPCR agonists, antagonists, and allosteric modulators with superior receptor subtype or signaling specificity over existing compounds\n\t\t\tNovel technologies or approaches to identify and characterize understudied and\/or orphan GPCRs in the brain, such as adhesion GPCRs\n\t\t\tNovel technologies and approaches to profile GPCR activity across phyla, during development, and in different brain regions\/cell types. \n\t\t\tDevelopment of methods to screen for novel GPCR interacting proteins. \n\t\t\n\n\t\tProtection of Human Subjects: Applications with data collection plans that involve multiple respondent groups (e.g., clients\/patients, therapists\/providers, supervisors, administrators) should address provisions for human subject protections and consenting procedures for all participant groups, accordingly. The NIMH has published updated policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection and clinical research data and safety monitoring (NOT-MH-15-025). The application&amp;#39;s Protection of Human Subjects section and data and safety monitoring plans should reflect the policies and guidance in this notice. Plans for the protection of research subjects and data and safety monitoring will be reviewed by the NIMH for consistency with NIMH and NIH policies and federal regulations.\n\n\t\tSee Section VIII.

        "Description": "Background\n\nTechnology-enabled HIV research has emerged in the past decade as a dynamic field that offers potential to bring HIV prevention and treatment efforts to scale. Technological innovations can help to reach vulnerable and at-risk populations such as minorities, adolescents, older adults, and individuals from rural settings who have challenges accessing conventional prevention and treatment services. The goal of this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is to support the development of new technologies for HIV prevention or treatment, or the application of existing technologies to behavioral and social science HIV research in these domains. For guidance on high priority scientific areas in this domain, applicants are encouraged to review the NIH HIV\/AIDS Research Priorities, and the NIMH Division of AIDS Research programs and priorities. The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program supports small businesses in developing technologies that can advance the mission of NIMH\/DAR and represents support for the research and development of technologies that corresponds to these identified research priorities. \n\nApplicants are encouraged to target the technological innovations to individuals who are most vulnerable to HIV acquisition or those who are living with HIV with poor health outcomes (e.g., adolescents, older adults, pregnant and post-partum women, and people with mental health issues). Applicants may consider reaching participants in a range of different venues and settings (e.g., Mental Health clinics, communities, schools, emergency rooms, criminal justice settings, via social media, etc.). Applicants may consider harnessing technical innovations to enhance objective assessment of neurocognitive abilities or functional impairments; expansion of diagnostic\/testing technology for vulnerable populations; and development of tools to objectively measure mental health associated with HIV infection.\n\nEmerging communication technologies may offer many opportunities for HIV\/AIDS research, such as: (1) collecting data in an adaptive way and allowing for more frequent, accurate, and inclusive assessments outside the clinical research environment; (2) bringing delivery of interactive content to scale; (3) covering broad geographic areas; (4) delivering technologies in highly tailored ways; and (5) providing tools to empower vulnerable populations to engage in healthy preventive behaviors. In the past five years, mobile technology platforms for adjunct delivery of behavioral interventions and health status monitoring have widely proliferated, enabling supplemental support to in-person behavioral treatments for improved health outcomes. Despite this growth, few mHealth interventions or applications have undergone systematic and rigorous usability evaluation prior to their dissemination. For broader impact and to fully achieve their potential, these technologies must be optimized through feedback from intended end-users and through the development of scalable platforms and processes to enable broad dissemination and incorporation into regular clinical practice.

        "Description": "Purpose\n\nDigital dentistry uses advanced materials and powerful manufacturing technologies aided by 3D imaging and processing software algorithms to produce dental devices and perform complex dental procedures. This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages innovation, optimization and customization of core technologies in digital dentistry that improve efficiency of oral healthcare delivery, effectiveness of clinical decision-making and outcomes of treatments associated with dental, oral and craniofacial (DOC) tissues. Among the areas of interest of this FOA, are development of digital imaging and image processing capabilities for dental radiology, and the integration of 3-dimensional additive manufacturing with imaging tools. This FOA also supports efforts to develop, integrate, adapt, optimize, and validate new and existing dental materials designed for additive manufacturing approaches in the repair, replacement and restoration of DOC tissues.\n\nBackground\n\nNew digital tools and technologies are revolutionizing dental and medical fields and making patient care easier, faster, safer, and more effective. They are modernizing the way dental devices, procedures, and products are enhancing the personalization and delivery of oral health care. Digital dentistry incorporates computer-controlled components such as: 3D cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging, computer-aided-design\/computer-assisted-manufacturing (CAD\/CAM), and 3D printing into the clinical workflow.  All disciplines of dentistry, especially prosthodontics, restorative dentistry and orthodontics benefit from routine application of CAD\/CAM for inlays, onlays, veneers, crowns, fixed partial dentures, implant abutments and full-mouth reconstruction. CAD\/CAM meets three challenges in dentistry: 1) ensures adequate strength of the restoration, especially for posterior teeth; 2) creates restorations with a natural appearance; and 3) makes tooth restoration easier, faster, and more accurate than other technologies.\n\nCAD\/CAM systems are composed of three major parts: 1) data acquisition unit-intraoral scanner; 2) software for designing virtual restorations; and 3) computerized device for creating the restoration, either through subtractive (milling\/grinding), or additive (3D printing) manufacturing. Both, subtractive and additive manufacturing approaches present advantages for specific clinical applications. The integration of 3D CBCT, CAD\/CAM, and 3D printing with advances in biomaterials has led to major improvements in dental care and treatment delivery. Paired with CAD\/CAM, 3D printing and advanced image processing functionality, CBCT can improve the success rate of interventions. Dentists can simultaneously plan the implant and restoration, produce a surgical guide, and then fabricate and place the permanent implant restoration, in some cases, all within an office and in a single patient visit with reduced risk of potential complications and improved treatment outcomes.\n\nGaps and Opportunities\n\nThis FOA addresses key technology gaps affecting the productivity and quality of care in dental practices. In certain cases, dental radiographs and computed tomography offer limited capacity to detect disease and accurately predict post-operative anatomy and physiology. Also, these tools are not always able to estimate mechanical force distribution through soft and hard oral tissues, dental biomaterials and their interfaces. Development and implementation of novel digital dentistry methods that integrate different imaging modalities (CBCT, MRI, ultrasound, optical) with advanced image processing algorithms and expert systems have the potential to overcome current technical limitations in assessing oral health, and reliable pre-surgical planning and surgical guidance.\n\nTo meet this challenge, this FOA is seeking to integrate advanced imaging, surgical expert systems, and computer-aided manufacturing capabilities into clinical workflow to drive patient-focused solutions. Moreover, 3D printing protocols and high-performance materials need to be optimized to complement existing capabilities to produce dental devices in a clinical setting. CAD\/CAM milling uses ceramics to produce restorations while 3D printing primarily uses polymer resins, and more recently, non-precious metal alloys coated with ceramic to produce restorations.  3D printing has capabilities to be highly accurate, handle complex shapes and small dimensions not achievable through CAD\/CAM.  Similar to CAD\/CAM, 3D printing can also be integrated into a clinical workflow to complement existing clinical capabilities.  The advantages offered by 3D printing create significant opportunities for digital dentistry to achieve more flexible, convenient and precise patient-centered solutions that are timely, cost effective, and complementary to current approaches\n\nSpecific Objectives\n\nThis FOA invites applications that propose development and implementation of novel digital dentistry methods by integrating different imaging modalities (e.g., CBCT, MRI, ultrasound, optical) with advanced image processing algorithms and expert systems to assist in oral health assessment, pre-surgical planning and surgical guidance. Development of advanced image processing software, including artificial intelligence (AI) tools, for image detection, classification, interpretation and clinical decision making in dental radiology are highly encouraged. Performance of new imaging-based systems must be verified and validated according to sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy requirements in support of specific intended preclinical and clinical utilities.  \n\nThis FOA requires that the performance of proposed tools, materials, devices and strategies be verified and validated for human safety and effectiveness according to recognized industry standards. Product development plans may include performance testing involving preclinical studies, human testing for feasibility, usability evaluation, and use of human tissue samples or secondary analysis of imaging and metadata from existing clinical studies. A quality systems approach should be applied for product development and testing of performance requirements according to required technical characteristics and clinically relevant conditions. Research of new materials and device production techniques must account for biocompatibility, mechanical, structural, and usability criteria needed to ensure clinical performance.\n\nExamples of research projects may include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n\n\tValidation of high-performance materials designed for 3D printing approaches that allow the production of dental devices in a clinical setting\n\tDevelopment of smart and secure expert software systems for treatment planning that account for oral tissue biomechanics and dental material properties\n\tDevelopment of dynamic surgical guidance systems for pre-surgical planning that incorporate real-time tracking capabilities with multimodal image fusion and surgical navigation\n\tImplementation of accurate dental image processing and AI software tools to detect disease, stratify risk and optimize patient-specific treatment\n\tDevelopment of new technologies for generation of digital impressions that penetrate gingiva non-invasively without fluid effects\n\tDevelopment and clinical implementation of multimodal diagnostic imaging and dedicated image processing tools for intra- and extra-oral applications\n\n\n \n\nProjects that are not appropriate for this FOA include:\n\n\n\tDevelopment of imaging reagents (e.g., probes, contrast agents) as a primary focus\n\tBiomarker discovery\n\t3D printing applications that include use of biological materials (e.g., bioprinting using cells)\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSee Section VIII.

        "Description": "Background\n\nSince its inception the field of genomics has been grounded in computational approaches. All facets of genomic research, such as processing raw sequencing signals, assembling genomes, calling variants, deriving insight from population sequencing studies, and designing and studying the implementation of genomics in clinical settings, are dependent upon computational, analytical, statistical and bioinformatics approaches. The scale of genomic data and the commitment of genomics researchers to share data resources have necessitated new computational paradigms for data processing, storage, organization, and access.\n\nAs the science of genomics continues to develop, producing data is no longer rate-limiting for genomic discovery; instead, processing, storing, accessing, analyzing, and deriving insight from genomic data, all computationally-based efforts, are emerging as the major challenges and bottlenecks. Understanding the complex relationships through which genotypes influence phenotypes, a key goal of the NHGRI, is increasingly dependent upon analytical, statistical and computational approaches. The rapid pace of sequencing technology development remains a driving force in genomics, and new genomic data types produced by novel technologies demand new modes of commercial analytical and computational support. Genomics increasingly underlies the study of complex networks and systems ranging in scale from single cells to complete organisms, presenting opportunities for commercial computational approaches to address previously intractable problems in basic biological sciences. The broadening adoption of genomics in clinical settings also requires new commercial computational approaches to enable improved outcomes, while the sensitive nature of some genomic data demands new commercial computational methods to balance data sharing and privacy considerations. Existing tools also require improvement and hardening, and the exponential growth of genomic data demands new scalable algorithms and new solutions for making genomic data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).\n\nIn recognition of the central role of computation and data science in genomics and to identify future needs and emerging opportunities, the NHGRI held an Informatics and Data Science workshop on September 29-30, 2016. Participants considered bioinformatics for genomics in both basic biology and clinical sciences and prioritized scientific opportunities for the NHGRI Computational Genomics and Data Science program over the next 3-5 years. Details from this workshop, including a workshop report, can be found here: https:\/\/www.genome.gov\/10001735\/computational-genomics-and-data-science-program\/.  Workshop participants identified several areas where continued or expanded support by NHGRI was thought important. Key recommendations highlighted the importance of maintained or enhanced support for development of: interactive tools for visualization and analysis of genomic data in both basic and clinical sciences; computational methods to investigate how genotype translates to phenotype; tools and approaches to enhance genomic data sharing; scalable algorithms for analysis of genomic data; methods to make genomic and phenotypic data and metadata FAIR, and others (for full list of recommendations, please see the workshop report).\n\nObjectives\n\nThrough this FOA, NHGRI seeks to fund innovative commercial product development in computational genomics, data science, statistics, and bioinformatics for basic or clinical genomic sciences and broadly applicable to human health and disease, as well as commercial product development stemming from improvement of existing software or approaches demonstrated to be in broad use by the genomics community.\n\nResearch topics appropriate for this FOA include, but are not limited to, development of commercial computational, bioinformatics, statistical, or analytical approaches, tools, or software for:\n\nThis FOA does not support:\n\nIn addition to this PAR, NHGRI participates in several funding opportunities https:\/\/www.genome.gov\/10000991\/nhgri-funding-opportunities-research\/, including the parent R01 and R21 announcements.\n\nAll applicants are strongly encouraged to contact NHGRI Program Staff to discuss the alignment of their proposed work with the goals of this FOA prior to submitting an application. \n\nSee Section VIII.

        "TopicTitle": "Novel Approaches for Relating Genetic Variation to Function and Disease (R43\/R44 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)",
        "Description": "Section I. Funding Opportunity Description\n\n  Background\n\nSequencing studies, including the 1000 Genomes Project and many disease studies, have identified more than 100 million sites in the human genome that vary among people.  However, it is likely that most of the variants do not contribute to differences in function, traits, disease risk, or clinical outcomes.  Thus, methods to determine which variants or sets of variants causally lead to differences in function are needed for a deeper understanding of the processes that lead to differences among people in many traits, including disease risk and clinical phenotypes.\n\nFor this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the term \u201cdisease or trait\u201d is used broadly, to encompass diseases, risk of diseases, protective effects against diseases, molecular phenotypes, organismal phenotypes, clinical phenotypes or outcomes, traits, responses to therapeutic drugs or vaccines, and other outcomes relevant to human health and disease.\n\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been highly successful in looking at genome-wide sets of genetic variants to detect their associations with disease and many other traits.  The GWAS catalog provides a comprehensive listing of almost 60,000 SNP-trait associations (https:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/gwas\/).  Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing studies have identified rare variants associated with disease. \n\nThe linkage disequilibrium patterns in the genome mean that disease- or trait-associated regions may contain many genes, other functional genomic elements, and variants.  Thus, determining which variants affect the function of genes or other genomic elements is a major challenge.  Even for situations with a higher likelihood of a variant being causal, such as a missense variant in a protein-coding region, the functional significance of this variant generally cannot be determined with available data.  When variants in known disease- or trait-associated regions of the genome are studied, it can be unclear how they contribute to phenotype, without, for example, replicating the phenotype in a model system.  In GWAS and whole-genome sequencing projects, the majority of disease- and trait-associated variants fall outside the coding regions and usually cannot be interpreted without substantial functional data. \n\nUnderstanding which variants in a person\u2019s genome lead to disease risk and changes in health is important for clinical implementation supported by commercial entities.  Genomic sequencing is increasingly being performed in clinical settings and precision medicine, and function data can be essential for classifying the variants identified in patients.  Linking high-throughput assays of variant effects to patients\u2019 phenotypic characteristics and treatment responses could increase our understanding of the functional consequences of variants.  The Genomic Medicine Meeting IX (https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28340351) discussed several issues related to using functional data to understand clinical genomes.  The recommendations included improving approaches for studies of animal and cell models to better understand genetic variants observed in human studies, improving the connection of functional data with standardized phenotypic data, and enhancing collaborations between clinical and basic scientists.  It will be important to determine what types of functional data would be most valuable for interpreting genomic variation in clinical settings at the individual and population levels, and how these data could best be used to advance the science of clinical medicine.\n\nMany resources help the interpretation of variants identified through association studies and clinical sequencing.  For example, the GTEx Project (https:\/\/www.gtexportal.org\/home\/) studied the effect of variants on gene expression across many tissues from many individuals.  The ENCODE Project (www.encodeproject.org), the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Program (https:\/\/commonfund.nih.gov\/epigenomics), and other genomics projects have mapped many types of functional genomic elements across the genome.  The ClinGen Project (https:\/\/www.clinicalgenome.org\/) is building an authoritative central resource that defines the clinical relevance of genes and variants for precision medicine and research.  The eMERGE Network (https:\/\/emerge.mc.vanderbilt.edu\/) is sequencing and assessing the phenotypic effects of ~100 clinically relevant genes, including studying the penetrance of rare variants. \n\nCommercial research efforts are needed to develop novel and transformative approaches for the next steps of identifying which variants, genes, and other genomic elements cause disease or result in other traits, and how they function to do so.  Even variants in relevant functional genomic elements may not cause differences in function.  A major need is to figure out what types of data, methods, and approaches will allow researchers to discover which genes or other genomic elements contribute to disease or traits, how variants in those elements result in higher or lower risk, and how they affect disease and biological processes.  Differences in function may be at the molecular or cellular level, leading to differences at the tissue and organismal level.  Generalizable approaches are needed that provide a deeper understanding and go beyond association to investigate the black box that currently exists between variants and diseases and other traits. \n\nScope\n\nThis FOA aims to support commercial research that develops novel, transformative, and generalizable genomic approaches to study the functional and disease effects of genomic variation, specifically how differences in sequence lead to differences in genome function, and to better understand how functional differences lead to disease risk or traits, or how to this knowledge can be used clinically.  These new approaches could fall into a range of activities, from exploring novel concepts, developing new methods, or developing new ways to analyze data that will substantially advance the ability to understand the functional consequences of sequence variation and provide fundamental knowledge to directly or indirectly accelerate scientific and medical breakthroughs that improve human health.  \n\nThis FOA aims to develop commercial approaches and tools that can be used broadly to study the relationships among genetic variation, function, traits, and disease.  The focus should be on developing commercial approaches that can be applied generally across multiple disease or trait outcomes.  Approaches may be tested using specific genomic elements, variants, cell types, diseases, traits, or model organisms; however, the generalizability of the approach must be explained well.  Approaches that are comprehensive across the genome and assay many or all variants at once are encouraged.  This PA is not intended for approaches that are only applicable to, or tailored towards, study of an individual disease, gene, or variant. \n\nStudies that examine how genetic variants affect molecular phenotypes (e.g., transcriptome and epigenetic profiles) are appropriate.  Studies that look at how genetic variants affect tissue or physiological function may be appropriate if the approaches can be generalized across variants, tissues, diseases, or function.  Some approaches may relate to the choice of samples or biological contexts to be studied; for example, studying functional data types in people prior to and during the time that they are developing a disease may be informative, as would studying people who are at high risk of a disease but have not developed it.  Proposed studies could also investigate genetic interactions, looking at combinatorial effects of multiple variants.  The application should explain how generalizable, broadly useful, and transformative the approaches will be.\n\nApproaches may include one or more of these aspects of genomics: \n\nFunctional genomics:  Applications may propose to develop new commercial functional genomic approaches to study how differences in sequence lead to differences in function, and how this informs disease or related biological processes.  This may be for specific types of variants, genomic elements, or genomic regions, for regulatory interactions, or for networks.  Use of model organisms or model systems is encouraged, especially where approaches are especially suited for these systems; however, information forthcoming from these models should be relevant to humans, e.g., through understanding of general principles or functional consequences of variants in conserved sequences, or methodological advances.  Examples include developing novel gene editing approaches in cell lines or model organisms or developing methods to study transcription factor binding differences and their effects on transcription and cellular phenotypes, insertion or deletion variants that affect nucleosome spacing and regulation, or variants that cause differences in epigenomic marks and their effects on disease risk.  Methods are encouraged that can help to infer causality or indicate which molecular function differences result in phenotypic differences. \n\nTechnology development:  Applications may propose to develop novel commercial genomic technologies that assay how sequence differences in functional genomic elements lead to differences in function and phenotypes.  Development of comprehensive, genome-wide, or high-throughput methods for commercial availability are encouraged.  Examples include new assays for function that can detect differences among variants in genomic elements, or improved sequence editing methods that allow single or multiple variants in functional elements to be studied, preferably for many functional elements at a time. \n\nClinical genomics:  Applications may propose to develop new commercial approaches that use functional genomics data to better interpret genomes in a clinical context.  This may include developing data sets to deduce whether variants are pathogenic or benign, developing methods to use functional data to better assess penetrance or predict individuals at risk of disease, developing approaches to connect in a comprehensive way phenotype data with functional data for sets of variants in the context of precision medicine and health, or other ways to interpret VUS.  Applications may also propose to commercially implement functional data or functional interpretation methods in clinical settings. \n\nData integration and analysis:  Applications may include the commercial development of novel or significant improvement of existing computational methods to integrate functional data and other data types to help to understand which variants are causal for phenotypes, and how variants lead to differences in function in relation to molecular or cellular phenotypes, clinical phenotypes, disease risk or mechanism, other traits, or other ways of interpreting clinical genomes.  Applications may propose to study which data types are most informative for understanding how variants affect function or disease risk or may be interpreted clinically. \n\nExamples of possible commercial research topics are:\n\n- Developing assays for relating genetic variation to function.  These could be assays of how molecular functions differ based on variants in functional genomic elements. \n\n- Developing tools that interpret the function differences and pathogenicity of variants.  This could be based on integrating various functional and population data types with phenotype data.\n\n- Providing reports of how genetic variants function differently as a service that might include lookup of variant functions in a database or be based on assays.\n\n- Developing tools that narrow the set of causal variants for a phenotype by integrating functional data sets.  For example, including tissue expression data could help limit the set to those in tissues related to a disease.   \n\n- Providing risk estimates by using data sets that integrate genetic information across the genome. \n\nThis FOA aims to support the development of novel commercial approaches in this area, so applications whose major aim is the production of functional data sets using existing or established approaches are not appropriate for this FOA; NHGRI program officers may be able to suggest other types of support for those activities.  A major outcome of this program will be results showing which data types would be most broadly useful for understanding how genetic variation leads to differences in the function of genomic elements that lead to differences in disease risk, traits, and pathogenicity.  Future funding announcements may be developed to scale up the production of such data sets. \n\nGenomic studies have generally lacked inclusion of substantial numbers of non-European-ancestry participants, so the production or analysis of data from individuals of diverse races, ethnicities, and ancestries is encouraged.\n\nNHGRI encourages investigators who plan to collect phenotype or environmental exposure data to use the standard protocols in the PhenX Toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org).\n\nProjects that focus on tumor or somatic cancer genomics will not be appropriate for NHGRI funding.\n\nTo enable the widest use of the functional data, any human subject consents should allow broad, general research use of the data, with no restrictions on the types of researchers who may use the data.  Where possible, use of samples consented for submission of data into unrestricted databases is strongly encouraged. \n\nIn addition to this PA, NHGRI participates in several funding opportunities https:\/\/www.genome.gov\/10000991\/nhgri-funding-opportunities-research\/, including the parent R01 announcements.  Under those parent announcements, NHGRI will support the development of resources, methods, and technologies that will accelerate research in understanding the structure of genomes, understanding the biology of genomes, understanding the biology of disease, advancing the science of medicine, and improving the effectiveness of healthcare.  NHGRI will also support research in several cross-cutting areas, including the ethical, legal and societal implications of genomics research, clinical implementation of genomics, bioinformatics, technology development, and research training and career development.  Although clinical trials are not allowed under this FOA, NHGRI supports such research under parent NIH FOAs that allow them. \n\nPotential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact NHGRI staff early in the application development process.\n\nSee Section VIII.

        "TopicTitle": "Commercializing Understudied Proteins from the Illuminating the Druggable Genome Project (IDG) (R41\/R42 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) ",
        "Description": "Background\n\nThe human genome has revealed a great deal about the human proteome, though significant portions remain understudied. Only a subset of expressed proteins demonstrates the requisite properties to serve as targets for the development of therapeutics. Many bona fide drug targets likely remain to be discovered in the &quot;Druggable Genome&quot; (DG), which can be defined as a subset of the ~20,000 genes in the human genome encoding proteins that have the potential to bind drug-like molecules. The term &quot;drug-like&quot; refers to the physical, biochemical, and pharmacological attributes of small molecule compounds that are generally recognized to be required for efficacious clinical drugs in humans. While the number of proteins in the DG is upwards of 3,000, the existing clinical pharmacopeia is represented by only a few hundred targets, leaving a huge swath of biology that remains unexploited. \n\nThe discovery of a disease association or the development of a useful tool reagent can accelerate research into a previous understudied protein, such as was the case for BRAF. Thus, while many interesting and critical biological processes and potential therapeutic avenues remain unexplored because an initial, catalyzing event has not yet occurred, the IDG Program will address this bottleneck by systematically querying these understudied proteins to find phenotypic associations and develop useful research tools.\n\nWhile at the informatics level, genome-, and proteome-wide tools can collate information and query all proteins, technical feasibility necessitates a narrower focus of experimental efforts into protein families for which there are definable understudied members along with existing technologies that can be readily adapted at the scale necessary for wholesale elucidation of their function and generation of tools.  During the Pilot Phase of the IDG, it was determined that the experimental focus of the IDG will be on the understudied members in the families of non-olfactory GPCRs, ion channels, and protein kinases, as these families contain adequate numbers of understudied members and are well-established druggable families with high potential to impact human health once disease associations are made. It is expected that experimental priorities of the proteins within these three families will change over the period of the project.\n\nThe IDG Consortium is expected to transform research by revealing a number of new activities and potential drug targets amongst these understudied proteins. Moreover, it is anticipated that the IDG Consortium will enhance our understanding of on- and off-target effects by establishing functional relationships among understudied members of the commonly targeted protein families.\n\nThus, the overall long-term goals of the IDG Program are two-fold:\n\nTo advance research through the development, broad dissemination, and use of community scientific resources to study human proteins for which publicly available information or active research is lacking to catalyze the discovery of novel biology, with a particular focus on understudied members of the protein kinase, ion channel, and non-olfactory GPCR families.\n\nTo demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of illuminating the roles of IDG proteins, permitting the expansion of such approaches to a broader array of protein families beyond the three families of proteins in the IDG Program.\n\nThe current IDG Consortium is made up of projects funded under the following FOAs:\n\nThe Knowledge Management Center (KMC; RFA-RM-16-024) aggregates knowledge from a protein-centric viewpoint across the entire human proteome, with an emphasis on the understudied non-olfactory GPCRs, protein kinases, and ion channels that are the focus of the experimental initiative. The KMC develops a knowledge portal (Pharos) that includes the aggregated data and metadata, a query interface, and deployed informatics tools along with community access to resources developed by the IDG Consortium.  The main goal of Pharos is to provide access to aggregated data and IDG resources for the broad scientific community.\n\nThe Data and Resource Generation Centers (DRGCs; RFA-RM-16-026) generate and validate new knowledge and\/or tools relevant to the understudied members of the protein kinase, ion channel, and non-olfactory GPCR families with the intent of broadly and rapidly disseminating knowledge and tools to the research community. As one of the essential goals of this program, NIH intends that tools and reagents generated by the IDG Consortium will be broadly available and distributed at minimal cost, and without undue intellectual property constraints, so that they can be used as widely as possible, enabling further investigation of understudied proteins by the larger scientific community.\n\nThe Resource Dissemination and Outreach Center (RDOC; RFA-RM-16-025) assists in the dissemination of data and tools and the overall coordination of the IDG Consortium. The IDG RDOC works with all IDG Consortium investigators to collect, curate, and disseminate information regarding critical tools and reagents being developed by the IDG Consortium through the IDG Portal.\n\nCutting Edge Informatics Tools Awards (CEITs; RFA-RM-18-011) are intended to add to the informatics capabilities of the IDG program.  These new tools will augment the capability of the KMC as well as the broader IDG Consortium in the following ways: (1) by developing and deploying tools to enhance the community&amp;#39;s ability to process, analyze, and visualize IDG data, (2) to prioritize new data resources and methods to be incorporated into Pharos that will strengthen predictions about physiological and disease associations around the understudied proteins, and (3) by developing methods to prioritize understudied IDG families (non-olfactory GPCRs, protein kinases, and ion channels) for deeper study using experimental assays both within the IDG pipeline or by the larger community.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nMultiple community workshops held during the pilot phase of the IDG program concluded that understudied proteins become \u201cilluminated\u201d when (1) there are tools to study the protein (e.g., tools that modulate protein activity) and (2) there is biochemical, cellular, or animal model evidence of disease\/physiological relevance. \n\nThe goal of this FOA is to fund Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) projects involving IDG-eligible proteins. The STTR program, also known as America\u2019s Seed Fund, is one of the largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization in the United States. This program allows US-owned and operated small businesses to engage in federal research and development that has a strong potential for commercialization. The STTR program is divided into three phases. Phase-I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed research efforts and to determine the quality of performance of the small business awardee organization prior to providing further federal support in Phase II.  Work in phase-II continues the R&amp;D efforts initiated in Phase I. Funding is based on the results achieved in Phase I and the scientific and technical merit and commercial potential of the project proposed in Phase II.

        "TopicTitle": "Commercializing Understudied Proteins from the Illuminating the Druggable Genome Project (IDG) (R43\/R44 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) ",
        "Description": "Background\n\n The human genome has revealed a great deal about the human proteome, though significant portions remain understudied. Only a subset of expressed proteins demonstrates the requisite properties to serve as targets for the development of therapeutics. Many bona fide drug targets likely remain to be discovered in the &quot;Druggable Genome&quot; (DG), which can be defined as a subset of the ~20,000 genes in the human genome encoding proteins that have the potential to bind drug-like molecules. The term &quot;drug-like&quot; refers to the physical, biochemical, and pharmacological attributes of small molecule compounds that are generally recognized to be required for efficacious clinical drugs in humans. While the number of proteins in the DG is upwards of 3,000, the existing clinical pharmacopeia is represented by only a few hundred targets, leaving a huge swath of biology that remains unexploited. \n\n The discovery of a disease association or the development of a useful tool reagent can accelerate research into a previous understudied protein, such as was the case for BRAF. Thus, while many interesting and critical biological processes and potential therapeutic avenues remain unexplored because an initial, catalyzing event has not yet occurred, the IDG Program will address this bottleneck by systematically querying these understudied proteins to find phenotypic associations and develop useful research tools.\n\n While at the informatics level, genome-, and proteome-wide tools can collate information and query all proteins, technical feasibility necessitates a narrower focus of experimental efforts into protein families for which there are definable understudied members along with existing technologies that can be readily adapted at the scale necessary for wholesale elucidation of their function and generation of tools.  During the Pilot Phase of the IDG, it was determined that the experimental focus of the IDG will be on the understudied members in the families of non-olfactory GPCRs, ion channels, and protein kinases, as these families contain adequate numbers of understudied members and are well-established druggable families with high potential to impact human health once disease associations are made. It is expected that experimental priorities of the proteins within these three families will change over the period of the project.\n\n The IDG Consortium is expected to transform research by revealing a number of new activities and potential drug targets amongst these understudied proteins. Moreover, it is anticipated that the IDG Consortium will enhance our understanding of on- and off-target effects by establishing functional relationships among understudied members of the commonly targeted protein families.\n\n Thus, the overall long-term goals of the IDG Program are two-fold:\n\n To advance research through the development, broad dissemination, and use of community scientific resources to study human proteins for which publicly available information or active research is lacking to catalyze the discovery of novel biology, with a particular focus on understudied members of the protein kinase, ion channel, and non-olfactory GPCR families.\n\n To demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of illuminating the roles of IDG proteins, permitting the expansion of such approaches to a broader array of protein families beyond the three families of proteins in the IDG Program.\n\n The current IDG Consortium is made up of projects funded under the following FOAs:\n\n The Knowledge Management Center (KMC; RFA-RM-16-024) aggregates knowledge from a protein-centric viewpoint across the entire human proteome, with an emphasis on the understudied non-olfactory GPCRs, protein kinases, and ion channels that are the focus of the experimental initiative. The KMC develops a knowledge portal (Pharos) that includes the aggregated data and metadata, a query interface, and deployed informatics tools along with community access to resources developed by the IDG Consortium.  The main goal of Pharos is to provide access to aggregated data and IDG resources for the broad scientific community.\n\nThe Data and Resource Generation Centers (DRGCs; RFA-RM-16-026) generate and validate new knowledge and\/or tools relevant to the understudied members of the protein kinase, ion channel, and non-olfactory GPCR families with the intent of broadly and rapidly disseminating knowledge and tools to the research community. As one of the essential goals of this program, NIH intends that tools and reagents generated by the IDG Consortium will be broadly available and distributed at minimal cost, and without undue intellectual property constraints, so that they can be used as widely as possible, enabling further investigation of understudied proteins by the larger scientific community.\n\nThe Resource Dissemination and Outreach Center (RDOC; RFA-RM-16-025) assists in the dissemination of data and tools and the overall coordination of the IDG Consortium. The IDG RDOC works with all IDG Consortium investigators to collect, curate, and disseminate information regarding critical tools and reagents being developed by the IDG Consortium through the IDG Portal.\n\nCutting Edge Informatics Tools Awards (CEITs; RFA-RM-18-011) are intended to add to the informatics capabilities of the IDG program.  These new tools will augment the capability of the KMC as well as the broader IDG Consortium in the following ways: (1) by developing and deploying tools to enhance the community&amp;#39;s ability to process, analyze, and visualize IDG data, (2) to prioritize new data resources and methods to be incorporated into Pharos that will strengthen predictions about physiological and disease associations around the understudied proteins, and (3) by developing methods to prioritize understudied IDG families (non-olfactory GPCRs, protein kinases, and ion channels) for deeper study using experimental assays both within the IDG pipeline or by the larger community.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n Multiple community workshops held during the pilot phase of the IDG program concluded that understudied proteins become \u201cilluminated\u201d when (1) there are tools to study the protein (e.g., tools that modulate protein activity) and (2) there is biochemical, cellular, or animal model evidence of disease\/physiological relevance. \n\nThe goal of this FOA is to fund Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) projects involving IDG-eligible proteins. The SBIR program, also known as America\u2019s Seed Fund, is one of the largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization in the United States. This program allows US-owned and operated small businesses to engage in federal research and development that has a strong potential for commercialization. The SBIR program is divided into three phases. Phase-I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed research efforts and to determine the quality of performance of the small business awardee organization prior to providing further federal support in Phase II.  Work in phase-II continues the R&amp;D efforts initiated in Phase I. Funding is based on the results achieved in Phase I and the scientific and technical merit and commercial potential of the project proposed in Phase II. The final phase (Phase-III) is for the small business to pursue commercialization objectives resulting from the Phase I\/II research and development activities with private entities. The NIH SBIR program does not fund Phase III, and NIH does not generally provide any Phase III funding to small businesses.\n\n Projects under this FOA would go beyond what the IDG\u2019s Centers can accomplish and\/or to validate and demonstrate the commercial utility of IDG proteins, reagents, data, and approaches.

Proposed studies must be applicable to at least one protein from the above list of IDG-eligible proteins to be considered for funding.\n\nThe National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) is the lead federal agency for scientific research on dental, oral, and craniofacial health and disease. NIDCR encourages projects on IDG-eligible proteins that are relevant to the human oral cavity, or that may illuminate pathways for future intervention for oral and craniofacial development, or to help treat dental diseases or to improve dental, oral and craniofacial health. Projects should have a high probability of commercialization either as assays, diagnostics or therapeutics. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact program staff for consultation before submitting applications. The NIDCR does not accept Phase IIB (competing renewal) applications.\n\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) encourages applicants to discuss the relevance of proposed projects to the mission of the NIDDK with program staff before preparing an application. The NIDDK is exclusively interested in disease-focused translational research relevant to its mission which includes obesity, diabetes, diabetic complications, endocrine diseases, liver and digestive diseases, nutrition, kidney and urological diseases, hematology, and inborn errors of metabolism. For Phase I applications, experiments must test the validity of IDG-eligible proteins for relevance in these areas; Phase II applications must contain strong preliminary data supporting their relevance to the interests of the NIDDK. For additional information on disease areas of interest to the NIDDK, please see https:\/\/www.niddk.nih.gov\/research-funding\/research-programs\/Pages\/default.aspx. Projects in areas that are primarily within the missions of other Institutes or Centers (ICs) of the NIH are not appropriate for assignment to the NIDDK.\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) encourages applicants to discuss the relevance of proposed projects to the mission of the NIMH with program staff before preparing an application. The NIMH is interested in the development of technologies that will enable discoveries of the role of these understudied proteins in neuroscience and in psychiatric diseases and for identifying relevant pathways.  Additionally, NIMH is interested in the identification of ligands or other modulators associated with these proteins. For additional information on neuroscience or disease areas of interest to the NIMH, please see https:\/\/www.nimh.nih.gov\/about\/strategic-planning-reports\/index.shtml\n\n \n\n The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) strives to develop innovations to reduce, remove or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in the translational research pipeline to speed the delivery of new drugs, diagnostics and medical devices to patients.  The NCATS approach is generally disease agnostic and does not favor applications in any disease area over another.  NCATS seeks projects on IDG-eligible proteins that will transform the translational science process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to patients more efficiently.  Projects of most interest to NCATS include those that focus on drug discovery and development, biomedical, clinical and health research informatics and clinical, dissemination and implementation research.  Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact program staff?.\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.",

Please direct any questions to the NCATS scientific contact.\n\nPurpose\n\nMore than 2 million individuals in the United States have an opioid use disorder (OUD), most starting with opioid analgesics prescribed to them or procured from diverted medications, but once addicted, patients often shift to illicit heroin or synthetic opioids (https:\/\/www.samhsa.gov\/data\/sites\/default\/files\/NSDUH-FFR1-2016\/NSDUH-FFR1-2016.pdf). Millions more misuse opioids, taking opioid medications longer or in higher doses than prescribed. The scope of this crisis is staggering, but there is a hope that scientific advances and the product development based on those scientific advances can offer strategies to help the nation overcome the crisis.\n\nThe FY 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided the resources needed to jumpstart an ambitious and targeted research strategy focused on tackling unmet needs of those with opioid addiction.  With the support of the President and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched HEAL, Helping to End Addiction Long-term, to provide science- and research-based solutions to the national opioid crisis and offer new hope for individuals, families, and communities affected by this devastating crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative will bolster research across NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at:  https:\/\/www.nih.gov\/research-training\/medical-research-initiatives\/heal-initiative. \n\nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) remains committed to addressing the national crisis on all fronts, with a special focus of its small business programs on encouraging biomedical product innovation to prevent new cases of opioid abuse and addiction and to treat those addicted.

IoT is not a single technology, but rather involves the convergence of sensor, actuator, information, and communication technologies. Emerging IoT implementations will use smaller and more energy-efficient embedded sensor technologies, more sophisticated actuators, enhanced communications, and advanced data analytics to collect and aggregate information and enable intelligent systems that understand context, track and manage complex interactions, and anticipate requirements. Market verticals that are potentially impacted by innovations in this area include connected cities and homes, smart transportation, smart agriculture, industrial IoT, and retail IoT.",

        "Description": "This topic focuses on innovations in information and communications technologies that rely fundamentally on quantum mechanical properties and interactions. Typically, such innovations will involve the generation, detection, or manipulation of quantum states to provide faster, more efficient or more secure information processing and communications. Proposals may include innovations at the component, sub-system, or system level that result in substantial and usable improvements in the generation, transmission, detection, storage, or processing of information, or the security and privacy of information. Proposed innovations must offer the potential for robustness, reliability, scalability, and operation at temperatures that are practical within the constraints of the intended application. Innovations at the component and sub-system level should aim for compactness and energy efficiency, consistent with the requirements of the application. \nExamples of technology innovations in the quantum computing subtopic could include qubit generation and detection; development of computational models (quantum circuits, etc.); error correction; software; hardware sub-systems and systems; and Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Examples of technology innovations in the quantum communications subtopic could include components such as sources, memories, repeaters, detectors; hardware sub-systems and systems; networks; cryptography; and key distribution.",

        "Description": "Purpose\n\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites applications that propose transformative engineering solutions to technical challenges associated with new development, substantial optimization of existing technologies and clinical translation of intraoral biodevices. Proposed technologies are expected to advance development of oral biodevices to clinical use, including but not limited to: precision medicine-based detection, diagnosis and treatment of oral and overall health conditions, and measurement of patient functional status and clinical outcome assessment. Areas of interest in this FOA include engineering approaches that allow integration of electronic, physical, and biological systems essential to the development of functional biodevices that are safe and effective for detection, diagnosis and treatment of oral and systemic disease. Products of this research will be proof-of-concept prototype biodevices, dedicated biosensors, associated core technologies and integrated approaches that enable development of safe and effective intra-oral biodevices intended for specific clinical applications. To streamline the development of oral biodevices that advance precision medicine-based approaches in clinical practice, this FOA encourages interdisciplinary collaborations across engineering, multifunctional sensors, pharmacology, chemistry, medicine, and dentistry, as well as between academia and industry.\n\n \n\nBackground\n\nDisease diagnosis relies on a variety of laboratory-based assays including microscopy, tissue and microbial cultures, immunoassays and nucleic-acid amplification. While development of many of these highly-sensitive and robust assays has revolutionized evidence-based diagnostics, in many situations, a continuous, non-invasive real-time assessment would offer additional significant advantages for delivery of evidence-based care.  \n\n \n\nAdvances in biomaterial sciences, biomanufacturing, microfluidics and nanotechnology are leading to the development of next generation simple, fast and reliable diagnostic devices, including biosensors, capable of real-time, continuous and noninvasive quantification of biological, chemical, and physical processes for health surveillance and rapid disease detection. Amperometric-, optical-, surface plasmon resonance-, enzymatic-, DNA-, phage-, and bacterial-based biosensors have shown significant promise for detection of a broad spectrum of biological analytes in medical laboratories and food bioanalysis.  Such technologies could be utilized in biosensors as well.  Additionally, biosensors are increasingly being used to augment therapeutic drug regimens by strengthening patient compliance. As biosensor technologies continue to advance towards smaller more accurate and application-specific integratable, wearable, and embeddable devices, these devices will become important components of medical diagnostics and monitoring that will allow for obtaining clinically-relevant outputs and endpoints indicative of health status, disease progression, and patients\u2019 compliance with treatment regimens.\n\n \n\nGaps and Opportunities\n\nThis FOA seeks to address key technical barriers affecting the safety and overall performance of biodevices specifically designed to function within the oral cavity. While the oral cavity offers unique advantages to access real-time, continuous, noninvasive, physiological measurements, the oral environment presents specific design and performance requirements that need to be addressed according to target clinical applications. Therefore, a systems engineering approach is needed to address major design challenges imposed by the oral environment, including: mastication forces, varying pH levels and temperatures, oral flora, adhesion to wet intraoral tissues, interference with speech, breathing and nutritional intake, material biocompatibility, and prevention of injury to oral tissues.\n\n \n\nThe oral cavity is an attractive site for developing integrated biosensor-drug delivery-mobile notification devices that would improve treatment of many oral diseases and, in certain cases, would enable systemic delivery of therapeutics in an effective and patient acceptable manner. Such systems would enable precise dosing of medications, enhance medication compliance, and reduce drug-related side effects. Pairing of pharmaceutical products with delivery devices requires close attention to their design, function, and efficacy. An oral biodevice with combined sensing and drug delivery features must consider many different design factors including, drug release profiles, performance requirements dictated by the oral environment and patient acceptance. Design of the release profile for integrated biosensor-drug delivery systems would depend on the condition being treated along with specific parameters of the patient\u2019s metabolism, genetics, epigenetics, diet, and intake of other medications.\n\n \n\nSpecific Objectives\n\nThis FOA seeks to advance meaningful development and substantial optimization of enabling technologies and systems engineering approaches to accelerate innovation and translation of intraoral biosensors and biodevices to clinical practice. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to: Improving the quality of biocompatible materials for optimal device functionality, preventing or minimizing material biofouling and advancing low-power\/miniaturized\/flexible electronics. In addition, this FOA will support advancing the capabilities of long-term power cells, integrating biosensors with implantable devices and mobile notification systems, securing wireless data transmission and developing technologies that enable reliable adhesion of biosensors and biodevices to wet intraoral tissues. \n\n \n\nExamples of research projects may include, but are not limited to the following:\n\nEnabling Technologies\n\n\n\tDevelopment of highly-sensitive and selective biodevices utilizing efficient transducing elements and biosensitive materials to detect small quantities of biomolecules.\n\tDevelopment of micro\/nanoscale biodevices for detection of biomolecules and\/or events resulting from enzymatic reactions.\n\tDevelopment of high fidelity, self-powered, stand-alone, biodevices with secure wireless data transmission t o allow adequate quantification and analysis of clinically relevant measures .\n\tDevelopment of label-free affinity biosensors with demonstrated selectivity, reproducibility and accuracy to chosen analyte(s) tailored to specific applications.\n\tOptimization of interactions between nanomaterials and biomolecules on the surface of electrodes, and development of biosensor arrays to improve reproducibility and accuracy of molecular detection or simultaneous detection of multiple validated biomarkers.\n\tImprovement of strategies to ensure materials\u2019 biocompatibility, device reusability, minimization of device biofouling, enhancement of device shelf-life and improvement of device adhesion to wet intraoral tissues.\n\n\nSystems Integration and Interoperability\n\n\n\tDevelopment and validation of fully-integrated biosensor-based systems that bring together components of sample preparation and analyte detection with interoperable digital health systems \/ internet-of-things (IoT) platforms \/ drug delivery systems \/ end-user functionality.\n\tEstablishment and validation of biological and engineering solutions for system-level tasks in sensing, interfacing, and designing control processes to improve performance of multi-functional sensors for intraoral applications.\n\tDevelopment of control systems using dynamically interfaced intraoral biosensors and actuators for flexible, highly-controlled drug release, electrical stimulation and other therapeutic outputs.\n\tImplementation of smart biodevices that support clinical decision-making for timely assessment and effective treatment of medical conditions.\n\tIntegration and validation of biosensors and processing technologies in embedded, continuous, intraoral diagnostic systems with individualized signal conditioning components for diagnostic and trend-detecting algorithms.\n\tMiniaturization and integration of biosensor components within an enclosure or a framework adequately designed to conform comfortably to the oral cavity.\n\n\nProjects that are not appropriate for this FOA include:\n\n\n\tBiomarker discovery\n\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII.

As biosensor technologies continue to advance towards smaller more accurate and application-specific integratable, wearable, and embeddable devices, these devices will become important components of medical diagnostics and monitoring that will allow for obtaining clinically-relevant outputs and endpoints indicative of health status, disease progression, and patients\u2019 compliance with treatment regimens.\n\nGaps and Opportunities\n\nThis FOA seeks to address key technical barriers affecting the safety and overall performance of biodevices specifically designed to function within the oral cavity. While the oral cavity offers unique advantages to access real-time, continuous, noninvasive, physiological measurements, the oral environment presents specific design and performance requirements that need to be addressed according to target clinical applications. Therefore, a systems engineering approach is needed to address major design challenges imposed by the oral environment, including: mastication forces, varying pH levels and temperatures, oral flora, adhesion to wet intraoral tissues, interference with speech, breathing and nutritional intake, material biocompatibility, and prevention of injury to oral tissues.\n\nThe oral cavity is an attractive site for developing integrated biosensor-drug delivery-mobile notification devices that would improve treatment of many oral diseases and, in certain cases, would enable systemic delivery of therapeutics in an effective and patient acceptable manner. Such systems would enable precise dosing of medications, enhance medication compliance, and reduce drug-related side effects. Pairing of pharmaceutical products with delivery devices requires close attention to their design, function, and efficacy. An oral biodevice with combined sensing and drug delivery features must consider many different design factors including, drug release profiles, performance requirements dictated by the oral environment and patient acceptance. Design of the release profile for integrated biosensor-drug delivery systems would depend on the condition being treated along with specific parameters of the patient\u2019s metabolism, genetics, epigenetics, diet, and intake of other medications.\n\nSpecific Objectives\n\nThis FOA seeks to advance meaningful development and substantial optimization of enabling technologies and systems engineering approaches to accelerate innovation and translation of intraoral biosensors and biodevices to clinical practice. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to: Improving the quality of biocompatible materials for optimal device functionality, preventing or minimizing material biofouling and advancing low-power\/miniaturized\/flexible electronics. In addition, this FOA will support advancing the capabilities of long-term power cells, integrating biosensors with implantable devices and mobile notification systems, securing wireless data transmission and developing technologies that enable reliable adhesion of biosensors and biodevices to wet intraoral tissues. \n\nExamples of research projects may include, but are not limited to the following:\n\nEnabling Technologies\n\n\n\tDevelopment of highly-sensitive and selective biodevices utilizing efficient transducing elements and biosensitive materials to detect small quantities of biomolecules.\n\tDevelopment of micro\/nanoscale biodevices for detection of biomolecules and\/or events resulting from enzymatic reactions.\n\tDevelopment of high fidelity, self-powered, stand-alone, biodevices with secure wireless data transmission to allow adequate quantification and analysis of clinically relevant measures.\n\tDevelopment of label-free affinity biosensors with demonstrated selectivity, reproducibility and accuracy to chosen analyte(s) tailored to specific applications.\n\tOptimization of interactions between nanomaterials and biomolecules on the surface of electrodes, and development of biosensor arrays to improve reproducibility and accuracy of molecular detection or simultaneous detection of multiple validated biomarkers.\n\tImprovement of strategies to ensure materials\u2019 biocompatibility, device reusability, minimization of device biofouling, enhancement of device shelf-life and improvement of device adhesion to wet intraoral tissues.\n\n\nSystems Integration and Interoperability\n\n\n\tDevelopment and validation of fully-integrated biosensor-based systems that bring together components of sample preparation and analyte detection with interoperable digital health systems \/ internet-of-things (IoT) platforms \/ drug delivery systems \/ end-user functionality.\n\tEstablishment and validation of biological and engineering solutions for system-level tasks in sensing, interfacing, and designing control processes to improve performance of multi-functional sensors for intraoral applications.\n\tDevelopment of control systems using dynamically interfaced intraoral biosensors and actuators for flexible, highly-controlled drug release, electrical stimulation and other therapeutic outputs.\n\tImplementation of smart biodevices that support clinical decision-making for timely assessment and effective treatment of medical conditions.\n\tIntegration and validation of biosensors and processing technologies in embedded, continuous, intraoral diagnostic systems with individualized signal conditioning components for diagnostic and trend-detecting algorithms.\n\tMiniaturization and integration of biosensor components within an enclosure or a framework adequately designed to conform comfortably to the oral cavity.\n\n\nProjects that are not appropriate for this FOA include:\n\n\n\tBiomarker discovery\n\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII.

        "TopicTitle": "Service-Ready Tools for Identification, Prevention, and Treatment of Individuals at Risk for Suicide (R43\/R44 Clinical Trial Optional)",
        "Description": "Research Strategy\n\nApplications should address the following additional issues:\n\nRationale\n\nThe rate of death by suicide in the United States has increased each year since 2005, from 11.0\/100,000 to 14.8\/100,000 of the population in 2018. Distinct subgroups have experienced even greater increases in the rate of suicide deaths during this period. With an estimated 20 suicide attempts per death by suicide, and millions of people seriously considering and\/or making plans for death by suicide each year, the cumulative toll on public health is enormous. Simultaneously, the field of suicide prevention research has seen unprecedented growth during the past decade, with sustained investment in research and health-systems changes by both federal and non-profit organizations that provide hope for reducing the annual suicide rate if evidence-based strategies can be widely implemented and sustained.\n\nConsistent with the goals of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, NIMH seeks to support research on strategies that could be used to reduce the rate of suicide in the US. To realize this goal, it is imperative that suicide prevention strategies be brought to scale at a level not seen before. There is a chasm between what research has demonstrated are useful strategies for suicide prevention and what is often delivered in healthcare systems. To bridge this gap and aid in the systematic implementation of evidenced-based suicide prevention services, the NIMH seeks to fund small businesses to develop and test service-ready tools for identification, prevention, and treatment of individuals at risk for suicide.\n\nResearch Scope and Objectives\n\nExamples of relevant research topics include but are not limited to:\n\nDelivery-oriented tools and technologies including mHealth platforms, existing passive sensing systems to enhance administration and precision of screening;\nDigital health based clinical decision-support tools for risk stratification that could facilitate efforts to match individuals to the appropriate intensity of services across service settings;\nsSystems-level strategies that incorporate predictive analytics, practice alerts, or clinical dashboards to reduce provider burden, facilitate surveillance of suicidal ideation and behaviors, and improve detection of at-risk individuals above and beyond what is possible with standard approaches;\nService-ready technology-based preventive interventions and crisis management approaches that are of appropriate intensity\/dose and are scalable, such that they can be delivered with fidelity by setting providers;\nScalable mHealth approaches that can be used to safely and effectively promote engagement and continuity of care during high-risk transitions (e.g., following evaluation in the ED, post-discharge from inpatient treatment) within and across settings;\nPragmatic technology-assisted strategies that can be used to monitor the quality of suicide prevention services in practice settings; and\nTechnology-assisted strategies and other scalable approaches (e.g., sustainable models for expert telephone consultation) that can be used to train providers to initial competence, to monitor quality, and to promote sustained fidelity in the delivery of research-supported suicide prevention services across a range of clinical modalities, including telehealth.\n\nApplications should incorporate strategies to ensure the proposed tool is scalable and sustainable and would be expected to:\n\nPropose optimized, practice-ready technology-assisted strategies that can achieve or surpass benchmarks for screening, identification of cases, referral to evidence-based care, and suicide prevention outcomes reported in previous efficacy studies;\nDevelop tools that can be integrated into practice with minimal reconfiguration;\nIncorporate design features that make the tools scalable and robust against implementation drift (e.g., using Technology as scaffolding or expert consultation via existing resources\/ other sustainable means to support delivery);\nUtilize deployment-focused approaches with proactive attention to workforce capacity and system-level factors that influence uptake\/implementation\nGiven the focus on developing pragmatic, service-ready approaches, the scope of work should also include:\nplans to assess and examine consumer-, provider- and setting- level factors that might be associated with uptake, implementation fidelity, and sustained use of the approach that is being developed and tested; and\nplans to quantify the resources necessary to implement the tool or strategy (e.g., provider qualifications, training and supervision requirements, therapist administration\/delivery time and burden).\nBecause this FOA is intended to support the development and testing of scalable, sustainable approaches, applications that propose complex, provider-intensive approaches\/interventions without incorporating features that can, by design, enhance scalability and sustained delivery with fidelity, will be considered of low priority for NIMH.\n\n\nFor Clinical Trial Applications: Consistent with the NIMH experimental therapeutics approach, this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is intended to support studies that not only test the service tool\u2019s effects on the outcomes of interest, but also inform understanding regarding the mechanisms of action of the service tool. As such, the scope of work must include specification of service tool targets\/mechanisms and assessment of service tool-induced changes in the presumed targets\/mechanisms that are hypothesized to account for the service tool outcomes (see Support for Clinical Trials at NIMH). In this manner, the results of the trial will advance knowledge regarding therapeutic change mechanisms and be informative regardless of trial outcomes (e.g., in the event of negative results, information about whether the service tool was successful at engaging its targets can facilitate interpretation).\n \n\nNIMH encourages a deployment-focused model of intervention and services design and testing that takes into account the perspective of relevant stakeholders (e.g., service users, providers, administrators, payers) and the key characteristics of the settings (e.g., resources, including workforce capacity; existing clinical workflows), that are intended to implement optimized mental health interventions. This attention to end-user perspectives and characteristics of intended clinical and\/or community practice settings is intended to ensure that the resultant interventions and service delivery strategies are acceptable to consumers and providers, to ensure that the approaches are feasible and scalable in the settings where individuals are served, and to ensure that the research results will have utility for end users and increase the likelihood that the end product will be commercially successful.\n \n\nNIMH encourages effectiveness research on potentially scalable preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions that focuses on practice-relevant questions. Accordingly, collaborations between small businesses, academic researchers and clinical or community practice partners or networks are encouraged. When possible, studies should capitalize on existing infrastructure (e.g., practice-based research networks such as the NIMH-sponsored Mental Health Research Network (MHRN), electronic medical records, administrative databases, patient registries, institutions with Clinical and Translational Science Awards) to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment (i.e., more rapid identification and enrollment) and to facilitate the collection of moderator data (e.g., clinical characteristics, biomarkers), longer-term follow-up data, and broader, stakeholder-relevant outcomes (e.g., mental health and general health care utilization, value and efficiency of intervention approaches).\n \n\nInformation about the mission, strategic plan, and research interests of the NIMH can be found at the NIMH website: . Applicants are also strongly encouraged to review the information on Support for Clinical Trials at NIMH.\n \n\nPotential applicants are also strongly encouraged to consult with NIH staff as early as possible when developing plans for an application (see Scientific\/Research Contacts, Section VII). This early contact will provide an opportunity to clarify NIH policies and guidelines and help to identify whether the proposed project is consistent with NIMH program priorities and the goals of this FOA.\n\nScale and Scope of Studies Covered Under this Announcement\nThis FOA will utilize the R43 (Phase I) mechanism to support pilot studies that are designed: to examine the feasibility of the proposed tool\/product, to provide an opportunity to refine and pilot test the experimental protocols, including assessment protocols and the experimental intervention protocol, as relevant; and to yield pilot data necessary for informing next steps and for enhancing the probability of obtaining meaningful results in subsequent, well-powered studies. Phase II applications (R44) should be focused on further development of the proposed tool\/product and on testing hypotheses that are supported by Phase I project data. Phase II studies should be powered to definitively answer the primary research questions.\n\n\nAll PD(s)\/PI(s)s submitting clinical trials applications consistent with NIMH priorities are encouraged to visit the NIMH Clinical Trial web page and consult with Scientific\/Research Staff regarding FOAs that are appropriately matched to the study scope and stage of intervention development and testing.\n\nApplications with data collection plans that involve multiple respondent groups (e.g., clients\/patients, therapists\/providers, supervisors, administrators) should address provisions for human subject protections and consenting procedures for all participant groups, accordingly.\nThe NIMH has published updated policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection and clinical research data and safety monitoring (NOT-MH-19-027 and Conducting Research with Participants at Elevated Risk for Suicide: Considerations for Researcher). The application\u2019s Protection of Human Subjects section and data and safety monitoring plans should reflect the policies and guidance in the NIMH notice and website. Plans for the protection of research subjects and data and safety monitoring will be reviewed by the NIMH for consistency with NIMH and NIH policies and federal regulations.\n\n\nSee Section VIII.

        "TopicTitle": "Novel Synthetic Nucleic Acid Technology Development (R43\/R44) (Clinical Trial Not Allowed)",
        "Description": "Purpose\n\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) solicits R43\/R44 grant applications to develop novel technologies that will enable no less than one order of magnitude improvement in commercial synthetic nucleic acid synthesis and constructs. Advances in genomics and more broadly in biomedical research have been greatly facilitated by significant and sustained synthetic nucleic acid increased throughput and capabilities combined with significant cost decreases. The goal now is to improve the quality and efficiency of commercial nucleic acid synthesis and synthetic constructs (e.g., longer oligonucleotides and constructs, faster turn-around times, greater accuracy, additional and less expensive modified nucleotides, multiplexing, higher-throughput, etc.) at lower costs per base with the anticipation that significant advances in any of these and related areas would make substantial contributions to the mission of NHGRI and the field of genomics, including NHGRI\u2019s other technology development goals.\n\nBackground\n\nThe abilities to rapidly commercially synthesize large numbers of individual and multiplexed oligonucleotides, and generate synthetic nucleic acid constructs have dramatically changed the nature of biological and biomedical research. Improvements in these spheres will continue to impact varied areas of genomics and biomedicine (e.g., synthetic genomics, saturation mutagenesis, and functional screens). Enabling significant advances with new nucleic acid synthesis and synthetic construct capabilities has the potential to lead to remarkable improvements in understanding, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease; advances in agriculture, environmental science and remediation; and our understanding of evolution and ecological systems.\n\nCurrent abilities to work with a variety of synthetic nucleic acids as oligonucleotides and synthetic constructs has been made possible by the enormous reduction of the cost of oligonucleotide synthesis along with vastly improved techniques for construct assembly in the past three decades. Costs have decreased from dollars in the 1990s to slivers of a cent per base today at scale. Synthetic nucleic acids (DNA, RNA and others that use a nucleic acid backbone) are in high demand and enable many current, emerging and future venues of discovery. However, the cost to completely synthesize DNA on the scale of an entire human genome was recently estimated as $1.5M, and high throughput capabilities, methods and knowledge for chromosome assembly on that scale are not available today. We remain far from achieving the low costs, high quality and scale needed to fully enable transformative research in genomics, biotechnology and clinical utilization. \n\nObjectives\n\nNHGRI seeks to fund commercial research efforts in novel enzymatic, biological, chemical, and physical approaches along with instrumentation for synthetic nucleic acids. New methodologies, and substantial advances beyond existing approaches are sought that would, if successful, significantly propel forward the field of genomics. Applicants may propose work on oligonucleotide synthesis, construct synthesis, or both, in a single application. The new technology proposed can innovate substantially novel approaches or instead significantly, no less than tenfold, improve existing methodologies for nucleic acid synthesis or synthetic construction. Applications failing to address or proposing less than a ten-fold improvement will be considered non-responsive to the FOA.  The FOA deliberately does not specify goals for cost, quality, throughput or nucleic acid lengths since achievable endpoints are likely to improve over the life of the opportunity, and applicants are encouraged to optimize and balance these and other relevant key attributes for the technology approach proposed. \n\nIt is expected that applicants will develop scientific and practical definitions of optimal cost, quality and lengths relative to enabling significant genomics opportunities. Applicants are expected to propose innovations or improvements of no less than an order of magnitude (at the minimum), based on state of the art at the time the application is submitted. Such improvements may be achieved by focusing on one critical factor, or a combination of important ones to develop complete systems or novel key components for nucleic acid synthesis or constructs.  Applications proposing novel methodologies or that solve existing limitations in the field are of especially high interest (e.g., length, accuracy, multiplexing, and natural or useful modifications, etc.). Novel methods that generate at scale large numbers of high-quality DNA or RNA oligonucleotides in pools or individually at low cost are sought.\n\nApplicants are also expected to work with a coordinating center NHGRI is seeking to establish to accelerate technology development and progress in the field of genomics (RFA-HG-20-019).  Grantees efforts will include actively and fully participating in a yearly meeting; as well as collaborating to synthesize findings and disseminate advances; developing and promoting standards for genomic technologies; facilitating technology transfer to research and clinical utilization, as appropriate; and working with the coordinating center as needed to assist in achieving the goals of this FOA.\n\nSee Section VIII.

        "Description": "The educational objective of this FOA is to provide opportunities for eligible SBCs to submit NIH SBIR grant applications to develop IDM STEM products that address student career choice and health and medicine topics for: (1) pre-kindergarten to grade 12 (P-12) students and teachers or (2) informal science education (ISE) audiences. The second educational objective is to inform the American public that their quality of health is defined by lifestyle. If this message is understood, people can begin to live longer and reduce the healthcare burden to society. Therefore, this FOA also encourages IDM STEM products that will increase public health literacy and stimulate behavioral changes towards a healthier lifestyle. The research objective of this FOA is the development of new educational products that will advance our understanding of how IDM STEM-based gaming can improve student learning. It is anticipated that increasing underserved and minority student achievement in STEM fields through IDM STEM resources will encourage these students to pursue health-related careers that will increase their economic and social opportunities. A diverse health care workforce will help to expand health care access for the underserved, foster research in neglected areas of societal need, and enrich the pool of managers and policymakers to meet the needs of a diverse population.\n\nIDM is a bridge technology that converts game-based activities from a social pastime to a powerful educational tool that challenges students with problem solving, conceptual reasoning and goal-oriented decision making. Well-designed IDM products mimic successful teacher pedagogy and exploit student interest in games for learning. IDM STEM products also integrate imbedded learning, e.g., what the student knows and new knowledge gained in the gaming process, into problem solving skills. IDM products provide real time student assessment. Unlike standardized classroom testing where student achievement is a pass or fail process, IDM-based assessment is interactive, does not punish the student, and provides feedback on how to move to the next level of play. IDM products are intended to generate long-term changes in student performance, educational outcomes and career choices.\n\nThis FOA also encourages IDM STEM products that will increase public health literacy and stimulate behavioral changes towards a healthier lifestyle. Types of applications submitted to this FOA may vary with the target audience, scientific content, educational purpose and method of delivery. IDM STEM products may include but are not limited to: game-based curricula, resources that promote attitude changes toward learning, new skills development, teamwork and group activities, public participation in scientific research (citizen science) projects, and behavioral changes in lifestyle and health. IDM STEM products designed to increase the number of underserved students, e.g., American Indian, Alaska Native, Pacific Islanders, African American, Hispanic, disabled, or otherwise underrepresented individuals considering careers in basic, behavioral or clinical research are encouraged.\n\nIDM STEM products may be designed for use in-classroom or out-of-classroom settings, e.g., as supplements to existing classroom curricula, for after-school science clubs, libraries, hospital waiting rooms and science museums. IDM products may target children in group settings or individually, with or without adult or teacher participation or supervision.\n\nThe proposed project may use any IDM gaming technology or platform but the platform chosen should be accessible to the target group.",

Such efforts might include the development of socially-assistive robots that can support engagement, social participation, and leisure activities of patients with MCI and AD\/ADRD.\n\u2022Cost-effective technology to create dementia-friendly cities and environments for individuals diagnosed with AD\/ADRD. This might include the development of alarm technology and tracking and location-monitoring devices to alert caregivers and others of the whereabouts of individuals with AD\/ADRD. Other advances might include innovative research to develop safer home environments, such as automatic shut-off valves for water (e.g. sink over flows when one forgets to turn off faucet) and electricity and gas (e.g. forgetting to turn off stove).\n\u2022Comprehensive telecare systems that can be used to support independence and personal safety of an individual with AD\/ADRD and other dementias. Such telecare systems might include community alarms, medication reminders, sensors for floods or extreme temperatures, detection of absence from normal activities (e.g. sitting in a chair, going to bed), fall detection, and unobtrusive sensors to monitor activities of daily living and vital signs that can be reported to a healthcare provider. Other advances might include the development of technology that would allow for in-place monitoring of individuals at all stages of AD\/ADRD. Ideally, such information would be integrated with other patient-relevant data in EMR.\n\u2022Wearable, mobile, or other technology to enable direct, objective, and continuous data capture of everyday functions in individuals with AD\/ADRD.\n\u2022Recent reviews of relevant scientific literature reveal the presence of disparities of care between diverse racial and ethnic groups of individuals with AD\/ADRD. To address such disparities, this FOA encourages research to develop educational training programs for physicians, nursing assistants, home-care aids, and long-term-care services. These programs would focus on training healthcare staff to provide culturally-appropriate care to the right patient, at the right time, and in the right setting.\n\nTools:\n\u2022Novel technologies to monitor, assist, or maintain daily functioning of older individuals with AD\/ADRD and other cognitive impairments.\n\u2022Manuals and training materials for existing evidence-based interventions that reduce the burden of caregiving for AD\/ADRD caregivers which can be used by community-based agencies and\/or healthcare organizations.\n\u2022A tool that could be sold to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans to allow them to accurately project future costs of caring for patients with AD\/ADRD and other forms of dementia.

Such technology might include the development of non-invasive methods and novel probes that monitor and manipulate the plasticity of neural circuits in the adult and aged nervous system. Further advances might include the development of novel markers of neural stem-cell function (proliferation, migration, and differentiation) as well as methods to assess the integration and function of stem cells in the aging and\/or diseased nervous system.\n\u2022Chip-based tools modeling human AD\/ADRD for applications in AD\/ADRD drug screening and development.

Several studies have indicated the lack of appropriate preclinical AD\/ADRD models as one of the barriers for successful development of AD\/ADRD therapeutics. Although animal models of AD\/ADRD have helped our understanding of AD\/ADRD pathogenesis to some extent, key genes and proteins that are critical to the pathogenesis of this disease exhibit many inherent species-specific differences and, consequently, there is a critical need for translation platforms that can accurately and reproducibly mimic the AD\/ADRD phenotype in vivo and be amenable to high-content screening and assay applications. Recent advances in stem-cell technology allow for successful generation of human neural-progenitor cells from skin cells of normal and AD\/ADRD patients. This technology could be exploited to develop cell-type-specific AD\/ADRD disease models replicating AD\/ADRD pathobiology on microfluidic chips.

        "TopicTitle": "Late-Stage Translation of Biomedical and Behavioral Research Results in Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases from Academic\/Non-profit Lab to Marketplace (SBIR [R43\/R44] Clinical Trial Not Allowed)",
        "Description": "Purpose\n\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages the translation of technology and therapeutic innovations from academic and other non-profit research sectors to the marketplace to advance the development of diagnostic and prevention tools or treatments for musculoskeletal, rheumatic or skin diseases. Small Business Concerns (SBCs) are encouraged to apply for this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant award to support late-stage translation of their work and move the lab technologies towards commercial dissemination. Applications to this FOA must describe partnerships and close collaboration between the original developers of these technologies and SBCs, which may be accomplished in a number of ways, including the use of multiple Program Directors\/Principal Investigators and\/or employing researchers from the original institutions in the SBCs.\n\nThe NIAMS\/NIH and other research sponsors have invested a significant amount of funds in developing new technologies to study musculoskeletal, rheumatic or skin diseases from basic, translational, and clinical perspectives through a variety of mechanisms, such as the NIH R01, R15, R21, R61, and P50, as well as NIH Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hub (REACH) Awards. These investments have produced a large amount of intellectual property for new technologies including drug candidates, biomarkers, diagnostic tools, and tissue engineering products. Since commercialization of a new technology or a potentially new therapeutic is a complex process, academic investigators with a focus on theoretical and mechanistic studies may not have the capacity to translate the lab technology concepts into products for clinical use. Consequently, these concepts for new technologies and drugs may slowly or never advance to commercial dissemination. This FOA is intended to utilize the NIH SBIR grant mechanism to move these innovations in NIAMS mission-relevant research from non-commercial laboratories into the commercial marketplace through collaborations between small businesses and non-commercial laboratories.\n\nResearch Objectives and Scope\n\nThis initiative will support late-stage pre-clinical studies on technology or therapy feasibility, and studies that are required for regulatory approval before clinical testing and making new lab technologies more practical for clinical use. Applications may include human subjects research; however, clinical trials are excluded. Applicants could propose to analyze samples from affected subjects and controls, conduct subject interviews or other procedures of clinical research; however, applications that propose to conduct intervention studies will not be considered responsive to the FOA and will not be reviewed.\n\nFor the purpose of this initiative, a late-stage translation is the continuation of previous research work that has shown promising data for development of a product. It is expected that the academic\/non-profit labs have conducted mechanistic studies and obtained preliminary results that provide a strong premise to further develop the technology or therapy. The concept of a product should be well defined.\n\nNIAMS mission-relevant research topics include, but are not limited to:\n\nDevelopment of therapies such as drugs, biologics, devices, cells, genes or behavioral interventions\n\nDevelopment of innovative strategies for the delivery of drugs\n\nBiomarker studies focusing on changes in disease-associated biochemistry, imaging, physiology or other measures that would facilitate screening and diagnosis\n\nDevelopment of outcome measures and methodologies that would enhance future observational studies and clinical trials\n\nDevelopment of 3D human tissue models for studying pathogenesis and\/or testing new therapeutics\n\nCollaboration between Academic\/Non-profit Lab and SBCs\n\nCommercialization of academic\/non-profit lab research results is normally supported by the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, in which the research institutions can significantly contribute to the research and development. This FOA specifically encourages late-stage translation to be completed mostly by the small businesses. A collaboration between academic\/non-profit labs and SBCs is encouraged, and the academic\/non-profit lab can perform a portion of the project in accordance with the SBIR policy. This initiative also encourages academic researchers, especially women and socially or economically disadvantaged persons, to participate in innovation and entrepreneurship. A technology transfer agreement between the research institution and the SBC should be in place.\n\nMilestone\n\nNIH emphasizes rigor and reproducibility of observed results. This FOA will support duplication of the critical experiments\/tests in a new setting (e.g., a different device model, a 3D human tissue model) to demonstrate the feasibility of a technology for commercialization or to support FDA approval for clinical trial. Because development of a new technology or therapy is inherently high-risk, attrition is anticipated as projects move through the process. To help mitigate this risk, applications must propose one or more milestones associated with each of the research plan&apos;s objectives, in each phase of the project. Milestones are goals that measure success and\/or efficacy that can be used for go\/no-go decision-making for the project, and should have quantitative success criteria and an associated rationale for each. Quantitative criteria should be robust and consistent with the state-of-the-art of the field. Details on methods, assumptions, experimental designs, and data analysis plans (if the results are quantitatively measured) should be included for each milestone. Each milestone must have a timeline and be incorporated into the overall project timeline, which should also be reflected in a Gantt chart.",

        "Description": "Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) aims to speed scientific solutions to stem the national opioid public health crisis by supporting the development of therapies and technologies directed at enhanced pain management through the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program. Specifically, this FOA is focused on applications directed at improving pain measurement and treatment.\n\nBackground\n\nThis FOA is part of the NIH HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) Initiative\u2014an aggressive, trans-agency effort to speed scientific solutions to stem the national opioid public health crisis. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at: https:\/\/www.nih.gov\/research-training\/medical-research-initiatives\/heal-initiative.\n\nMore than 25 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, a highly debilitating medical condition that is complex and lacks effective treatments. In recent decades, there has been an overreliance on opioids for chronic pain despite their poor ability to improve function. This contributed to a significant and alarming epidemic of opioid overdose deaths and addictions. Innovative scientific solutions to develop alternative treatment options are thus critically needed.\n\nResearch Objectives \n\nA. Scientific\/Technical Scope\n\nApplications received under this FOA must fall within the scope of the HEAL Initiative, including but not limited to:\n\u2022Tools and technologies to better understand the biological underpinnings of chronic pain, including new screening tools and models focused on pain and development of pain therapies\n\u2022Discovery and pre-clinical development of non-addictive pain treatments, including small molecules, biologicals, and devices\n\u2022Advancing new non-addictive pain treatments through the clinical pipeline\n\u2022Develop improved pain management strategies for acute and chronic pain conditions, including development of novel pain management technologies and devices, and objective pain measurement\n\nB. Clinical Trials\n\nClinical Trials are required through this program announcement. The rationale for a clinical trial must be based on (i) an unmet medical need; (ii) a plausible biological mechanism; and (iii) robust supporting data, e.g., from non-clinical (in vivo and\/or in vitro data) studies or preliminary clinical studies that demonstrate there is an adequate scientific foundation to justify the proposed trial. The scientific premise for the trial should be based on preclinical and\/or clinical data from rigorously performed studies (see http:\/\/grants.nih.gov\/grants\/guide\/notice-files\/NOT-OD-15-103.html).
